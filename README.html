## Get Started

Our framework streamlines the development process by providing a unified environment for both front-end and back-end development using React and Node.js architecture. With our solution, developers can seamlessly work within a single environment, eliminating the need to switch between separate front-end and back-end setups. This approach enhances productivity, simplifies collaboration, and accelerates the development of web applications.
